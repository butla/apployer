# TODO primary
# Make installable and testable for py26. This will require to make an "extra feature" (see
#   setuptools docs on "declaring extras") out of appstack expansion.
#   Only dependency for this feature would be networkx.
# Brokers serving instances that hold no data (like all WSSB brokers) can be marked
#   as "recreatable" or something. Then, they could be recreated and rebound to apps when WSSB
#   configuration changes. Right now it won't happen, because there's no universal way of
#   recreating a service instance.
# add app timeout parameter (default should be 180 seconds), think about enxanced timeout and
#   differentiation between continuous crash and timeout
# make all docstrings conform to Google standard


# TODO secondary
# add retrying of CF CLI methods
# automatically download CF CLI
# Change "order" parameter in app configuration to "after" (a list). This way we can explicitly
#   define that some application needs to be created before the given one so it can work.
#   E.g. in hdfs-broker config: after: [auth-gateway]
#   Those dependencies can be resolved on the graph.
# Add a meaningful integration test and get rid of some unit tests with a lot of mocks.
# make creation of upsis and service instances parallel
#   (just use a ThreadPool for running them)
# document how to add a new application, broker, upsi, etc.
# switch all addresses to HTTPS
# add options for bastion addressess, users and key-files
